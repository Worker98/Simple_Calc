# Simple_Calc
To those who need count quickly.
Have problems with calculations (for example, need to count square root from any number or something else)?
Just use it and you'll got the result.
With using command "case" (or "switch") you can choose your option. For example, at first you need to insert 2 numbers.
Then choose your option (like writing "=", "+", "/", "*" or "^" [to count a^2, where a is your number]).
If nessesary, you also can write "sqrt" for finding square root.
That's all, folks!
